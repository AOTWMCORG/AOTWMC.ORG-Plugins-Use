Explanation of AOTWMC.ORG and the use of our custom built plugins




# About the Server

AOTW is a Minecraft anarchy server where players can explore, build, and interact freely. We use custom plugins to manage gameplay mechanics, prevent exploits, and provide unique features for our community.

# Custom Plugins

Most of our plugins are developed by UptightPlum (Discord: one-two), with a few developed by the server owner. Some of the key custom plugins include:

Anti-Illegal Items – Removes items that exceed allowed enchantments or stack sizes to prevent exploits.

Anti-Op – Automatically removes operator status from players who are not whitelisted.

AOTW-TpLimiter – Limits teleport commands from EssentialsX or HomeSweetHome within a configurable radius of spawn.
